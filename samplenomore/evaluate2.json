We can the most of the things, like, you know, which will this is the frequent issue I was faced. Actually, like so the thing is, like, as a senior person, I how how I will design the React component is, like, to wherever, like, you know, if the parent component, uh, changes, then the child component will will be rerender. That is fine. But in case of parent component, parameters uh, which is used in the child component, which is changes, then I can go with the React dot memo or inside the component, which is taking more calculated calculation like time time consuming calculation, uh, task which is used That is basically rerender the, uh, calculation every time the components loads. In that case, I'll use the use use memo So event event driven, um, so say, for example, whatever the event which is tied up with the controls on the component, will also reenter the, uh, component. So there, I'll use the use callback. Also, there is a developer tools which is available in Chrome. So I have used the React profiler. In case of Redux thing, used Redux toolkit to find out the state changes as well as the React profiler, which will narrow down the component and, uh, find out which component is taking more number of free render and finding out that and putting appropriate fix or or, like, you know, use memo or use callback, I I'll be using those. Instead of, like, no back giving a batch update, so instead of, like, each and every time, you know, changes is done, giving a a update instead of that, following the the processes done, then doing a batch update will improve the performance. React nineteen, we have the concurrent update. That will improve the performance. Also, like, you know, the rerender, we can avoid.",

Also, like, the re re redact tool kit I have used for the slices. So there will be, like, container container slice. So under that so the form may contains more number of sections. Each section will be having a separate slice to store the information. So it is kind of a base slice, which is for the form. Uh, inside that, we will be having a multiple, uh, you know, nested child phrases. Uh, so also, like, in case of the rerendering thing, so, uh, I have you the React memo and, uh, React call callback, and the parent parent parameter is got changed. So I have used the React dot memo as well. So in in case of, like, a nested nested, uh, form fields and validating to those things. So each and the form contains form is like, you know, the form is the outer content. The, uh, each and every form will have the second So each section composed with the multiple field fields. So, uh, each field will have the their own validation rule. So each hierarchy would be the form container. Under underneath, there will be a second component. So in the section component, we'll have the form list form field array. So each form field will have the different types and validation properties. To be executed when the form when the form is submitted. So that case, the component is split split into multiple chunk of components, and those components are, you know, composed form builder. So in case of the validation validation component itself, you know, do the it is basically using a single responsibility principle to divide it all the components and compose all the components as a container component. The container components basically, like, you know, which will responsible for the state of the form fields information and a validation thing. So, basically, like, once the form inputs are touched or untouched, all the validation will be happened, and the respective component will take care of the, uh, functionality and, uh, basically, like, do the nested check checking of the form builder. So that's how the has their rule engine. So that rule engine basically, like, you know, runs the rule against validations of each field that is customizable. The component customized validation will be triggered Uh, also, like, since each and every component is into separate, uh, you know, single single single responsibility component, That will, know, incorporate by default if it is record for a use a use memo or a use callback. Or react dot memo, which is really a record. So that is, you know, by default. So once composing all this component, it will give a performance when we go for the nested, uh, fields in the form.",

                "message": "Yes. So, an as an senior person, I'll be go with the approach of, uh, as a, you know, solid principle So solid principle is guy which will have the, uh, like, no uh, and solid, uh, s for solid. So responsibility, SRP principle, single responsibility. So each and each and every component I design, I go with the approach of say, a single responsibility. Say, for example, if it is a customer component or the employee component, it should be uh, you know, uh, have the behavior of only the customer. In case of the customer and the employee component, like, they wanted to, you know, print the report. So the print print is going to be another responsibility component component or the library which will be used, it will be in into the, uh, customer or employee to make use of that. Yeah. Instead of clubbing it, uh, each and every, uh, re reports into, uh, uh, into into the, uh, employee and customer component, I'll be going with the solid design principle So similarly, like, open closed principle, like, I have used the the component should be, I know, open for modification. So, component should be open for extension and closed for modification. So similarly, like, you know, it shows the component. So that component may basically incorporate all the basic parent component behavior base component behavior, and so who arise, you know, going to use the the HOC principle, then the the drill component, HOC component, which will be created based on the HOC and the parent component. So that will inherit all the parent and add the additional enhancement or the we gave us to the component. So as a enterprise level, everything like no. So I in my current pro in my current project, I have used the next mono repo. It's going to be out only one, you know, bundling, which will be uh, say, for example, the bundling in the sense or now creating a com core component, uh, class libraries. Core component library that will be shared across the multiple micro front ends. So each and every there will be a one host application and multiple, you know, multiple remote remote applications. So on the say, example, the host will be you know, uh, combining of composing of all the remotes. So, uh, the core component which is created as part of the, you know, single mono report, that will be shared across. There is there will be one bundling or the library, which will be singleton that will be shared across the remote application as well. So to avoid the duplication of downloading of you know, bundling or the script on the browser side, when the application is getting loaded. So the as a enterprise level, the this is the, no, micro front end approach Based on the domain, we can split up the modules and, uh, create the, you know, uh, single responsibility micro front ends and composing all the all the remote application and in into the host application using a next mono repo approach. So I also like we can go with the webpack model from federation approach also. We can go and design the micro front end. That is fits for the, you know, enterprise large scale application. Scale up the application because each and every model will be like, you know, we can develop, deploy independently affecting the other micro front ends. So the team which is working on you know, product listing, though they can do the development deployment independently using CICDs. Similarly, like, other teams also, like, the card payment team, and they can work on their own, uh, scope, and then they can do the development and deployment independently using c a c d deployments. So that's all, like, I will be design I have designed the application. And more or less, like, no, the enterprise approach, definitely, we have to go with the state management. So the state management, I have used combination of, uh, uh, Redux toolkit plus, uh, RTK Query. So that is that is how I have used the so, uh, for for the data management on the UI side. So that will also, like, caching the the RTK query will caching the frequent result. Also, like, instead of submitting when the user is, you know, frequently requesting the same data if it is a static data. So maybe, like, uh, instead of hitting the server, that will be sold from the RTK Query cache. That's how I'll be so for the enterprise level application, it should be scalable, and it should be maintainable. Also, it will be, you know, separate as it should follow the separation of concern. All also, like, the in the data store, basically, like, you know, using the redact toolkit and RTK that will give the enterprise level",

                "message": "Yeah. Actually, in a roll a large scale application development, definitely, road based splitting will be required. So in case of, like, no the parent route may lead into another set of child routes as well. So parent route be configured as part of the application bootstrapping. So on the child route, which is because the, uh, application the application loads, the user can see only the, uh, the host page. The host page which will be, like, you know, once logged in they'll be landed on the landing page. So or or it may be a dashboard page or the landing page. So from the dashboard page or the landing page, they can able to navigate to other pages. So that is called as a child route. So each and the child route needs to be, uh, logically grouped and the child route, uh, will be, you know, child routes are grouped, and then the component hierarchy needs to be developed that component will be created as a lazy import and dynamic import. We can use to load the components. So instead of loading all the component at a stage when the obligation in is load, because landing page will not have provide all the data at at the at the the same time on the same page to fill up the things. But in case of the user navigates to the particular module or the navigation, then that navigation needs to be categorized based on the navigation So all the logical grouping of routing will be formed, and the child routes will be invoked the components and then lazy invoke the dynamically using lazy loading. So that's how I'll be building the component. So when the component is loading for a lazy, right, so we have to use this as funds. So because we don't know, like, whether the component will be having any issues when when the lazy loading of component will maybe take like, if it is takes some some time to load or, like, no first time or I in that case, I'll be using a suspense that basically, like, once the component is available, it will be served or rendered on the page Otherwise, uh, there will be a fallback mechanism. So we can, you know, do a fallback, you know, logic we do it. So we can say, for example, if the component is not loaded, then it'll land out to the error error error page. While component loading, so we can use this for using the React assessments. That will basically anyhow, like, we are using a lazy loading of components. Once a component is started, you know, downloading on your on the browser, so meantime, there will be a loading spinner or, uh, or any kind of spinner or we can run it. And once the component is downloaded, then the component will be shown to the our skeleton loader, we can show And once that is done, the component is loaded successfully, then the component will be shown on the, uh, page. I'll be designing the child routes. So child routes, basically, based on the application modelization, So that will be having a one high level route. So each and every every route will have the the will have, uh, will will it has its own child routes? So all the child routes will be grouped and create the you know, components which will be loading dynamically or lazily.",

                "message": "Yeah. Sounds good. So this question basically, like, you know, when we developing a dashboard, so each and the each and the dashboard will contain multiple widgets. So so each and each and every widget will be a single responsible that should follow the SRP principle that should have its own, uh, data management as well as the in working API call and load the widget and render it on the window. So the dashboard layout that is responsible for in case of, like, any shared data uh, which is available, uh, which just needs to be sold to the uh, the widgets, which is, uh, going to be loaded on the dashboard layout, that is responsible for the uh, any kind of, uh, API call info API call, the container approach, like, you know, that will responsible for a fetching the API and serving the state to the, uh, dashboard component. So each and every comp every, uh, widgets will be, you know, like, you know, or it it be independently loaded. And, when the widgets getting loaded to I'll be using a shimmery app shimmer UI or, like, a skeleton loader, we can call it as. Skeleton loader will be, uh, showing as a loading. Then each and every widget will be, uh, gets loaded independently That will invoke their its own API call and putting into the data onto the store and for the future use. And when the user doing a refresh, So it will check for the refresh timing. So if it is if it is not elapsed, then it is fetching from the cache. RTK query cache. So, uh, from the store as also. So that's how I will be designing the, uh, widgets The the each and every widgets will be loaded on the you know, dashboard layout. So for the visualization stuff, basically, uh, I can go with the SVG SVG graphs or or, like, you know, or, like, you know, there there is a a lot of chart libraries are available, like, using a g a g grid a g chart also there. So a g chart d three charts, we we we can have more control on the d three chart as for the visualization. So, uh, also for the ChartJS, which will provide different types of charts like pie chart, doughnut chart, spider chart, and bar chart, line chart, So all this thing which is provided by the by default by the chart JS and the AG chart as well. So for more we want to we wanted to do some hierarchical hierarchical flowchart, all these thing, can use d three chart too for for the visualization purpose. So each and every chart, like, you know, uh, we the component which we are design designing, so each yeah. We can define the, uh, you know, um, refresh mechanism We can set the timing for the refresh. To get the real time data on the chart. So, otherwise, like, web target which can update the chart data, then free that data will be, uh, immediately reflected on the UI. So for the performance side, I have used web web worker to improve the performance of the the dashboard because which which is basically, like, offloading the processing And, basically, the main thread free up the main thread from and offload the content to the web worker that will perform the data manipulation or data update on the UI. That's how I'll design the I have designed the dashboards.",
