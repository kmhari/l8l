    "additional_questions": "\n\nQ1: You need to load streaming data from Kafka into Snowflake with minimal latency while handling schema evolution. Describe your implementation approach.\nG1: Green flags:\n- References Snowpipe for continuous ingestion\n- Mentions VARIANT type for schema flexibility\n- Discusses validation steps before transformation\n\nRed flags:\n- Suggests batch loading every hour\n- Proposes altering tables frequently during ingestion\n- Ignores error handling for schema changes\n\nQ2: Describe a specific project where you migrated an on-premise data warehouse to Snowflake. What architecture decisions did you make to leverage Snowflake's unique features?\nG2: Green flags:\n- Details usage of time travel for data recovery\n- Mentions separate compute/storage scaling benefits\n- References consumer account sharing implementation\n\nRed flags:\n- Only discusses data movement without architecture\n- Confuses Snowflake with generic cloud storage\n- Claims schema changes were more complex than on-premise\n\nQ3: How would you design a Snowflake query to calculate the percentage contribution of each sales region to total quarterly revenue, including handling null regions?\nG3: Green flags:\n- Uses COALESCE for NULL handling\n- Demonstrates window SUM() over partition\n- Considers performance impact of DISTINCT\n\nRed flags:\n- Suggests correlated subquery for total calculation\n- Uses GROUP BY with non-aggregated columns\n- Forgets to handle NULL regions separately\n\nQ4: When optimizing a slow-running query joining five large fact tables in Snowflake, what three diagnostic steps would you take and why?\nG4: Green flags:\n- References query profile analysis first\n- Mentions clustering key evaluation\n- Considers materialized views tradeoffs\n\nRed flags:\n- Immediately suggests hardware upgrades\n- Focuses only on query syntax without metrics\n- Proposes denormalization without justification\n\nQ5: How would you calculate quarterly sales velocity for new customers where initial order dates are sparse and some records have conflicting timestamps from multiple source systems?\nG5: Green flags:\n- Proposes timestamp reconciliation strategy\n- Handles sparse data with window frame specifications\n- Considers temporal table approaches\n\nRed flags:\n- Suggests simple MAX() without validity checks\n- Assumes clean data from all sources\n- Uses recursive CTEs without performance caveats\n\nQ6: How would you handle errors and retries when processing a large CSV file using Python?\nG6: Green flags:\n- Uses try/except blocks\n- Implements checkpointing\n- Logs specific error details\n\nRed flags:\n- Ignores error handling\n- Suggests restarting entire process\n- No awareness of file chunking\n\nQ7: When designing a Python script to transform data before loading into Snowflake, what memory management strategies would you employ for very large datasets?\nG7: Green flags:\n- Processes data in chunks\n- Uses generators for lazy evaluation\n- Leverages Snowflake's staging capabilities\n\nRed flags:\n- Loads entire dataset into memory\n- Unfamiliar with Python generators\n- Ignores streaming possibilities\n\nQ8: If a scheduled Airflow task fails repeatedly, what steps would you take to diagnose and resolve the issue?\nG8: Green flags:\n- Checks task logs first\n- Verifies dependencies and upstream tasks\n- Considers resource constraints\n\nRed flags:\n- Immediately reruns without investigation\n- Blames infrastructure without evidence\n- Not familiar with Airflow UI debugging\n\nQ9: Describe a situation where you optimized an Airflow pipeline's performance. What metrics improved and how?\nG9: Green flags:\n- Cites specific metrics (e.g., runtime, resource usage)\n- Details configuration changes\n- Measures impact quantitatively\n\nRed flags:\n- Vague description without metrics\n- Credits team without personal contribution\n- Confuses Airflow with underlying processing engine\n\nQ10: Imagine you're designing a data warehouse for an e-commerce platform. How would you structure the product dimension in a star schema versus a snowflake schema?\nG10: Green flags:\n- Provides concrete examples of product attributes in each schema\n- Discusses trade-offs between storage efficiency and query complexity\n- Considers business requirements like reporting needs\n\nRed flags:\n- Fails to provide specific product dimension examples\n- Ignores performance implications of schema choice\n- Suggests using snowflake schema universally without justification\n\nQ11: Describe a time when you had to choose between star and snowflake schema for a project. What factors influenced your decision and what was the outcome?\nG11: Green flags:\n- Provides specific project context and business requirements\n- Articulates clear decision criteria (performance vs storage)\n- Shares measurable results from the implementation\n\nRed flags:\n- Describes hypothetical rather than actual experience\n- Cannot recall specific performance metrics or outcomes\n- Attributes decision solely to team preference without rationale",
