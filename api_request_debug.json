Js has the event group in the base which handles the asynchronous operations. So no chance is capable of concurrency by this, uh, event loop only. Talking about how Node. Js handles the asynchronous task, So, basically, what event loop does, event loop follows that if any one request come towards the server, so it basically checks that what are the things that, uh, JS and other asynchronous tasks are provided to the LibUV portion, which, uh, LibUV further has the thread pull the execution, and LibUV handles all this input output operations on any API calls or any database operations which are totally performed by PingoPuV. So now event loop, there are two main things. There is micro task queue and there are macro task queues. Basically, this handles that how the should be performed. So this micro and macro is inside the LibUV context and this are this is how the node node. Js handles the asynchronous execution. Basically, when a request comes, Node. Js provides that to even to even look That's what the JS can do and provide that to this. And apart from that, request to get standard. So this is how the concurrence is",

Because these are very popular as well inside the NPM. We can there are there are millions of downloads inside the NPM packages for the rate limiting package. Apart from that, if I want to implement my own rate limiting thing, what I will do, I will be using any of the lightweight database. Like, let's say, there is DynamoDB. If I'm using the AWS Coverity. So what I will do, I will keep the check of the IPs. So whatever request are, uh, hit by the particular IP, we have the request object inside the app dot tools. So what I will do, I will have a middleware. And in inside that middleware, I'll be having the request And inside the request, I will have the IP on which the the user is requesting from. So what I will do, I will keep the track of that request, and I will be putting that into inside the DynamoDB. So what what I will do inside the middle part, I will have a simple check that whether person has been requesting so much of time or what amount of user is requesting? Like, I will set a rate limit. Let let's say a user can only call the API for fifty times, let's say, instance. So what I will do, I will keep every time the check from the DynamoDB that whether this person has accessed the portal in in the rate limit. Or if that person has is requesting so much of time, what I will do, I will block that user or I will block that IP.",

Traditionally, we were using the rest API. Inside the rest API, there is the control inside the back end side that whatever the parameters are needs to be provided will only be provided. So the complete control is inside is for is the back end side. And front end can only request the API, and they can only pro they can be only getting the things which are I would say, are decided by the back end. But what happened Facebook got the problem where were developing the ecommerce this what I would say, this social media platform. Where they face that what there are multiple variable things that any front end developer might need to access. Right? So at that point of time, front end knows that what are the things that are required by my side. Right? So what the GraphQL does is that it provides the limited control to both to the front end developer to access the parameters that they want. So I would say that if I'm having the feature where front end guys only needs and they can be provided, and they're most at what are the exact amount of things that, uh, they require to call from the back end.
