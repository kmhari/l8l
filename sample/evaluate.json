        "message": "Sure. So, the Node.js handles the asynchronous operations and how it is being handled in the event loop plays a necessary role in this particular process. For example, like even Node.js is working with a Node-driven architecture actually. So, for example, like it has an event loop architecture thing. So, the event loop architecture thing is basically consists of like we have the code environment and then the execution context. The code environment is the place where the actually memory allocation is going to happen and the execution context is where the actual line of code is going to execute it. So, Node is kind of a single-threaded programming language. That means like the program can run from one by one. That means a line by line. So, it's not kind of a multi-threaded language. In order as to perform asynchronous operations, we will be using callbacks and promises. So, how it is being handling in the Node.js? Like Node.js first eventually check the top-level code. So, the top-level code is like kind of any file reading systems or any consoles, any import location, any import exporting. These are the top-level codes. Then it will look for the promises that is actually going to result. After that, it will resolve for the setTimeout and setTimeout. So, these are actually happening in the event loop with certain limitations actually. So, first the top-level code is executed and then the microtask queue. So, inside the microtask queue, it will have like the promises in it. Actually, like what are the promises is actually going to resolve. And after that promise, it will precedence to the setTimeout and setInterval. After that only, it will take to import IO operations actually. So, this is how the Node.js is handling the asynchronous operations. The Node.js actually handles the asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises. But eventually, it will be working in kind of an even loop architecture in Node.js. So, based on the preferences in the code execution level, it will get looped one by one after a particular task gets completed. So, Node.js also handles the multithreading with using libuv package, which is libuv that is inbuilt in Node.js. So, these are the topics that I would say for handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.",

So, for example, like if I do have like DB connections and then the file reading system and then one more like process or next queue operations, these are kind of steps like there are certain process needs to be executed. For example, if a particular line of code actually has the first line with console.log and the next line with the promises and then the for loop and then what I can say like one more setTimeout interval. So, in that case, what actually it will have, first the console statement will get printed and then it will wait for the promises to get resolved because it is non-blocking the main thread actually. After that, it will go for the loop to execute. Then it will look for any macro task that is any setTimeout and setInterval is going to resolve.

So, like for example, like it's kind of say throttling actually. So, the rate limiting comes with the concept of throttling only. For example, like if at all any 10 to 100 number of API request is going to happen for a second, we have to limit those requests actually. For example, this certain limit of time, this amount of API request is going to happen. So, for that, we have to make some throttling function in the main.js file or main.js file. In the Next.js application, it comes with the inbuilt throttling key in it actually. So, the throttling actually comes what actually it will do like, it will rate limiting the API request even before it is getting entered into the main.js file actually.
