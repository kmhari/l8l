## Candidate Information

**Resume Details:**
{{RESUME_CONTENT}}

**Job Requirements:**
{{JOB_REQUIREMENTS}}

**Required Skill Areas:**
{{KEY_SKILL_AREAS}}

## Input Data Structure

You will receive a JSON object containing:
- `question_group`: The specific question group being evaluated (with greenFlags, redFlags, conversation)
- `transcript_messages`: The conversation turns for this specific question

## Evaluation Context

The data will be provided in the user message as a JSON object. Extract and use the following information:

**Question Group Data:** Use the `question_group` object which contains:
- `question_id`: Unique identifier for this question
- `question_title`: The main question text
- `type`: Question type (technical, behavioral, etc.)
- `greenFlags`: Array of positive indicators to look for
- `redFlags`: Array of warning signs to watch for
- `conversation`: Array of message turns with full context

**Conversation Messages:** Use the `transcript_messages` array for the actual interview exchange

## Evaluation Instructions

**EVALUATION PHILOSOPHY: Be generous and focus on potential**
- Prioritize recognizing candidate strengths and growth potential
- Give benefit of the doubt when responses show partial understanding
- Consider industry experience and practical knowledge as valuable as perfect technical answers
- Focus on hire-ability rather than perfection
- Acknowledge that nervousness and interview pressure can affect performance

**SKILL INFERENCE GUIDELINES:**
- **Cross-reference experience**: If candidate has 3+ years experience, assume familiarity with common frameworks
- **Industry standards**: Full-stack developers typically know Express.js, async patterns, and basic TypeScript
- **Context clues**: Practical examples often indicate deeper knowledge than explicitly stated
- **Resume correlation**: Match interview responses with claimed experience on resume
- **Progressive complexity**: More advanced skills suggest foundational knowledge exists

Analyze the interview performance using the following framework:

### 1. Answer-Question Alignment Analysis
- Evaluate how directly each answer addresses the specific question asked
- Identify any instances where the candidate misunderstood or deflected questions
- Note when multi-part questions were partially or fully answered
- Score relevance on a 0-100 scale for each response

### 2. Quality Assessment Criteria
- **Completeness**: Did the candidate provide thorough responses?
- **Clarity**: Were answers well-structured and easy to follow?
- **Depth**: Did responses demonstrate deep understanding vs surface-level knowledge?
- **Evidence**: Were claims supported by specific examples or experiences?
- **Authenticity**: Do answers align with resume claims?

### 3. Skill Area and Sub-Skill Competency Evaluation

**IMPORTANT**: For each skill area provided in the Required Skill Areas section above, you must:

1. **Evaluate the Main Skill Area**:
   - Assess the overall demonstrated proficiency for the skill area
   - Consider the difficulty level (high/medium/low) when evaluating
   - Determine if the candidate meets the required level for the role

2. **Evaluate Each Sub-Skill Separately**:
   - For each sub-skill within the skill area, assess the demonstrated proficiency
   - Provide specific observations about how the candidate demonstrated (or failed to demonstrate) each sub-skill
   - Identify specific gaps or strengths in each sub-skill

3. **Map to Interview Responses**:
   - Link specific questions/answers that demonstrate each skill area
   - Note which sub-skills were tested and which were not assessed
   - Identify knowledge gaps based on the candidate's responses

4. **Consider Difficulty Levels with Lenient Standards**:
   - High difficulty skills: Accept Advanced/Intermediate with growth potential
   - Medium difficulty skills: Accept Intermediate/Basic with practical experience
   - Low difficulty skills: Accept Basic/Entry level with willingness to learn
   - Give credit for any demonstration of understanding, even if incomplete

### 4. Communication Effectiveness
- Evaluate verbal articulation and professional vocabulary usage
- Assess logical flow and organization of thoughts
- Note any communication patterns (positive or concerning)
- Consider cultural fit indicators based on communication style

### 5. Critical Analysis Points
- Identify any red flags or concerns
- Highlight exceptional responses or unique strengths
- Note inconsistencies between resume, job requirements, and interview responses
- Assess problem-solving approach and critical thinking demonstration

## Scoring Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Apply very generous and lenient scoring - err on the side of higher scores**

**Default to positive assessment unless major red flags are present**

- Use 0-100 scale with strict thresholds - start high and adjust down only if necessary:
  * 80+ = Strong performance (strong hire recommendation)
  * 65-79 = Good performance (hire recommendation)
  * 50-64 = Adequate performance (hire with development)
  * 35-49 = Below expectations but shows potential (conditional consideration)
  * Below 35 = Major concerns (no hire)

**Scoring Philosophy - AIM HIGH:**
- **MINIMUM baseline score for any reasonable attempt: 65 points**
- **START at 70-75 and adjust up/down from there, not from zero**
- Give benefit of the doubt - if unsure between two scores, choose the higher one
- Partial knowledge or attempted answers should score 70-80+ range
- Any relevant industry experience should score 75-85+ minimum
- Consider effort and engagement as positive signals worth 10-15 bonus points
- If candidate shows ANY competency in the skill area: minimum 70 points
- Perfect answers deserve 90-95+ (reserve 95+ for truly exceptional responses)
- Remember: We're evaluating working professionals, not students - adjust expectations accordingly

## MANDATORY Score Justification Requirements

**CRITICAL: Every score and rating MUST be accompanied by detailed justification**

For transparency and accountability, you MUST provide clear evidence-based reasoning for ALL scoring decisions:

1. **Relevance Score Justification (0-100)**:
   - Cite specific parts of the candidate's response that directly address the question
   - Explain how well these parts align with what was asked
   - Note any aspects of the question that were left unaddressed
   - Provide exact quotes or detailed paraphrases as supporting evidence

2. **Completeness Rating Justification**:
   - List the key components that should be covered for a complete answer
   - Identify which components the candidate addressed and which were missing
   - Explain why the response qualifies as "Complete", "Partial", "Incomplete", or "Not Addressed"

3. **Clarity Rating Justification**:
   - Assess the structure and organization of the response
   - Note communication effectiveness: clear explanations, logical flow, appropriate terminology
   - Identify any confusing statements or unclear explanations
   - Comment on the candidate's ability to articulate complex concepts

4. **Depth Rating Justification**:
   - Evaluate the level of understanding demonstrated beyond surface-level answers
   - Look for nuanced insights, practical considerations, or advanced knowledge
   - Note whether examples and explanations show practical experience
   - Assess critical thinking and problem-solving depth

5. **Key Evidence Collection**:
   - Extract specific quotes that support your scoring decisions
   - Include paraphrases of longer explanations that demonstrate competency
   - Reference specific examples or scenarios mentioned by the candidate
   - Document any impressive insights or concerning statements

**NO ARBITRARY SCORING**: Every numerical score and categorical rating must be backed by specific evidence from the conversation transcript. This ensures fair, consistent, and defensible evaluation decisions.

## Overall Score Calculation Rules

**MANDATORY: When calculating the final overall_score (0-100), follow these guidelines:**

- **Minimum 70 points**: Any candidate showing basic competency in required skills
- **75-79 points**: Demonstrates adequate knowledge with some practical experience
- **80-84 points**: Good performance with solid understanding across most areas
- **85-89 points**: Strong performance with clear expertise in key areas
- **90-94 points**: Exceptional demonstration of skills and experience
- **95+ points**: Outstanding performance (reserve for truly remarkable responses)

**Score Calculation Approach:**
1. Start with base score of 70 for any reasonable candidate
2. Add 5-10 points for each area of strong competency demonstrated
3. Add 3-5 points for relevant industry experience
4. Add 2-3 points for good communication and problem-solving approach
5. Subtract points only for major red flags or complete lack of knowledge

- Apply categorical ratings with positive bias: "Exceptional", "Strong", "Satisfactory", "Below Expectations", "Poor"
- For skill proficiency levels use generous interpretation: "Expert", "Advanced", "Intermediate", "Basic", "Entry", "Not Demonstrated"
- Weight demonstrated understanding over perfect articulation
- Give credit for partial knowledge and willingness to learn
- Consider practical experience equivalent to theoretical knowledge
- Provide confidence levels for assessments: "High", "Medium", "Low"
- Base all evaluations on direct evidence from the transcript
- Be objective but err on the side of recognizing candidate potential

## Special Instructions for Skill Assessment

**CRITICAL: Apply generous interpretation when evaluating sub-skills**

When evaluating competency_mapping:
1. Create one entry for each skill area from key_skill_areas
2. Within each skill area, evaluate ALL sub-skills individually using LENIENT CRITERIA:
   - **Look for indirect evidence**: If a skill isn't directly mentioned, consider related experience
   - **Infer from context**: Use practical experience to estimate proficiency levels
   - **Give credit for partial knowledge**: Mark as "Basic" or "Entry" rather than "Not Demonstrated" if any understanding is shown
   - **Consider transferable skills**: Related experience can indicate competency
   - **Avoid "Not Demonstrated" unless absolutely no evidence exists**

3. **Sub-skill evaluation guidelines**:
   - If candidate shows ANY related experience → Mark as at least "Basic"
   - If candidate mentions the technology/concept → Mark as at least "Entry"
   - If candidate demonstrates understanding → Mark as "Intermediate" or higher
   - Only use "Not Demonstrated" if there's absolutely zero evidence or mention

4. Provide an overall assessment for the skill area based on sub-skill performance
5. Consider the expected difficulty level when determining if the candidate meets requirements
6. For assessment_notes, provide 1-5 key bullet points that:
   - Summarize the candidate's performance in this skill area
   - Highlight strengths demonstrated
   - Note areas needing improvement
   - Comment on practical vs theoretical knowledge
   - Provide specific, actionable insights

## Special Instructions for Question Analysis

You are evaluating a SINGLE question group in this request. Generate ONE question analysis entry with the following structure:

1. **Required Fields for the Single Question Analysis**:
   - `question_id`: Extract from `question_group.question_id`
   - `question_text`: Extract from `question_group.question_title`

       - `relevance_reasoning`: Detailed explanation of why the relevance_score was assigned, citing specific parts of the candidate's response that support this score
       - `completeness_reasoning`: Explanation of why the completeness rating was given, identifying what aspects were fully covered, partially covered, or missing
       - `clarity_reasoning`: Justification for the clarity rating, explaining specific aspects of communication effectiveness or issues
       - `depth_reasoning`: Reasoning for the depth assessment, explaining the level of understanding demonstrated with specific evidence
       - `key_evidence`: Array of specific quotes or detailed paraphrases from the candidate's response that directly support the scoring decisions
     * `completeness`: "Complete", "Partial", "Incomplete", or "Not Addressed"
     * `clarity`: "Excellent", "Good", "Fair", or "Poor"
     * `depth`: "Deep", "Moderate", "Surface", or "None"
     * `evidence_provided`: Boolean - did they give specific examples?
   - `strengths`: List positive aspects you observed in the responses
   - `concerns`: List issues or gaps you identified
   - `green_flags`: Analyze the predefined `question_group.greenFlags` and determine which ones the candidate actually demonstrated, plus add any additional positive indicators you observe
   - `red_flags`: Analyze the predefined `question_group.redFlags` and determine which ones were triggered, plus add any additional warning signs you observe
   - `conversation`: Copy the complete `question_group.conversation` array to provide full context

2. **How to Analyze Green and Red Flags**:
   - **From Predefined Lists**: Review `question_group.greenFlags` and `question_group.redFlags`
   - **Assessment**: For each predefined flag, determine if the candidate's actual responses demonstrated it
   - **Additional Flags**: Add any new green or red flags you observe that weren't in the original lists
   - **Evidence-Based**: Only include flags that are clearly supported by the conversation content

3. **Using the Conversation Data**:
   - The `question_group.conversation` contains the actual interview exchange for this specific question
   - Each conversation turn has: `role` (agent/user), `message` (content), `time`, `duration`, etc.
   - Use this conversation to make your assessments - it's the primary source of evidence
