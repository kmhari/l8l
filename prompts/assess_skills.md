## Input Data Structure

You will receive a JSON object containing:
- `transcript_messages`: The complete conversation turns from the entire interview
- `key_skill_areas`: Array of skill areas with sub-skills to evaluate

## Assessment Philosophy

**HOLISTIC EVALUATION: Analyze the complete interview context**
- Consider the entire conversation flow, not individual question fragments
- Look for skill demonstrations across multiple conversation segments
- Cross-reference different parts of the interview for comprehensive evidence
- Prioritize practical experience and real-world application over theoretical knowledge
- Give credit for contextual understanding and professional experience

**GENEROUS INTERPRETATION: Focus on potential and demonstrated competency**
- Prioritize recognizing candidate strengths and practical experience
- Give benefit of the doubt when responses show partial understanding
- Consider industry experience and practical knowledge as valuable evidence
- Focus on demonstrated ability rather than perfect articulation
- Acknowledge that interview pressure can affect performance

## Competency Assessment Instructions

### 1. Comprehensive Transcript Analysis
- Read through the entire transcript to understand the candidate's background and experience
- Identify all instances where skills are demonstrated, referenced, or implied
- Look for patterns across multiple conversation segments
- Consider context clues and practical examples as evidence of competency

### 2. Cross-Reference Evidence Collection
- Map skill demonstrations to specific conversation segments
- Look for consistent themes and repeated concepts across the interview
- Consider how different skills interconnect and support each other
- Identify transferable skills that indicate broader competency

### 3. Skill Area and Sub-Skill Competency Evaluation

**IMPORTANT**: For each skill area provided in the Required Skill Areas section above, you must:

1. **Evaluate the Main Skill Area**:
   - Assess overall demonstrated proficiency considering ALL evidence from the transcript
   - Consider the difficulty level (high/medium/low) when evaluating
   - Determine if the candidate meets the required level for the role
   - Look for both direct mentions and indirect evidence of competency

2. **Evaluate Each Sub-Skill Separately**:
   - For each sub-skill within the skill area, assess demonstrated proficiency holistically
   - Collect ALL evidence from across the entire transcript that relates to each sub-skill
   - Provide specific observations and examples from different parts of the conversation
   - Consider experience levels and practical application evidence

3. **Evidence-Based Assessment**:
   - Link specific conversation segments that demonstrate each skill area
   - Note which sub-skills were clearly demonstrated and which were inferred from context
   - Identify knowledge demonstrated through practical examples and experience claims
   - Consider resume correlation with interview responses

4. **Generous Competency Standards**:
   - High difficulty skills: Accept evidence of practical experience and solid understanding
   - Medium difficulty skills: Accept demonstrated familiarity and basic application knowledge
   - Low difficulty skills: Accept any mention or contextual evidence of exposure
   - Give credit for related experience that indicates likely competency
   - Consider years of experience as strong evidence for foundational skills

### 4. Proficiency Level Guidelines

**Use generous interpretation when assigning proficiency levels:**

- **Expert (5+ years focused experience)**: Deep expertise with advanced implementation experience
- **Advanced (3-5 years regular use)**: Solid competency with some advanced features and best practices
- **Intermediate (1-3 years experience)**: Practical working knowledge with standard use cases
- **Basic (Some exposure/training)**: Understanding of fundamentals and ability to work with guidance
- **Entry (Aware of concept)**: Basic awareness and willingness to learn
- **Not Demonstrated**: Absolutely no evidence or mention in the entire transcript

**Assessment Philosophy:**
- **START with assumption of competency** if candidate has relevant professional experience
- **Infer proficiency** from practical examples and work history
- **Give benefit of doubt** when evidence suggests familiarity
- **Consider context** - senior roles imply certain foundational skills
- **Look for transferable skills** that indicate broader capability

### 5. Confidence Assessment Guidelines

**High Confidence**: Multiple clear examples, specific technical details, demonstrated practical experience
**Medium Confidence**: Some evidence from conversation, practical examples, or strong contextual clues
**Low Confidence**: Limited evidence, inferred from related experience, or brief mentions

### 6. Assessment Notes Requirements

For each skill area, provide 3-5 bullet points that:
- Summarize the candidate's overall performance in this skill area
- Highlight specific strengths and evidence found across the transcript
- Note practical vs theoretical knowledge demonstrated
- Identify any gaps or areas for development
- Provide specific, actionable insights based on the complete interview

## Special Assessment Rules

**Cross-Reference Experience Mapping:**
- If candidate has 3+ years in a technology stack, assume familiarity with common patterns
- Industry experience suggests exposure to standard practices and tools
- Senior roles imply leadership and architectural decision-making skills
- Full-stack experience suggests familiarity with both frontend and backend concepts

**Contextual Skill Inference:**
- Database experience implies SQL knowledge
- Web development experience implies HTTP understanding
- Cloud platform usage implies deployment and infrastructure awareness
- Team lead experience implies communication and project management skills

**Evidence Aggregation:**
- Combine multiple weak signals into stronger evidence
- Consider practical examples as strong indicators of competency
- Value problem-solving approaches that demonstrate understanding
- Recognize when candidates describe real-world implementation challenges

## Scoring Guidelines

**Apply generous and evidence-based scoring:**

- **Demonstrated Competency Baseline**: If ANY evidence of skill usage exists, minimum "Basic" proficiency
- **Experience-Based Assessment**: Years of experience strongly indicate proficiency levels
- **Practical Application Priority**: Real-world examples outweigh theoretical knowledge gaps
- **Contextual Assessment**: Consider role requirements and industry standards
- **Growth Potential Recognition**: Factor in learning ability and technical curiosity

2. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: All ratings must be supported by specific transcript evidence
3. **Complete Skill Coverage**: Ensure every sub-skill is evaluated with appropriate proficiency levels
4. **Detailed Assessment Notes**: Provide meaningful insights for each skill area
5. **Confidence Ratings**: Assign appropriate confidence levels based on evidence strength
6. **MANDATORY Numerical Scoring**: Every skill area and sub-skill must include numerical scores

### Numerical Scoring Requirements (0-100 Scale)

**CRITICAL: Every skill area must include `skill_score` (0-100) and every sub-skill must include `sub_skill_score` (0-100)**

**Score Ranges:**
- **90-100**: Expert level - Exceptional demonstration with advanced insights and best practices
- **80-89**: Advanced level - Strong competency with solid understanding and practical application
